# Forage - Accenture: Data Analytics & Visualization
Portfolio of work from the Accenture Data Analytics &amp; Visualization Virtual Internship Program via Forage.

## Task 1: Project Understanding

* Read & interpret the brief from Social Buzz to identify the purpose of the project.
* Read the internal stakeholders chart to better understand the roles & responsibilities of the team.

Social Buzz is a social media & content creation company that has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it. The Accenture team has been given three tasks to fulfill: an audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, and analysis of popular content. As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with the analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

* Read & understand the data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question: top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
* Perform data cleaning to prepare the data sets for analysis.
* Perform data modeling to identify the top 5 categories.

To identify the top 5 categories by popularity, I worked with the Reaction, Content, & Reaction Types data sets. I performed data cleaning on each of the data sets, using Excel, including: removing irrelevant columns, removing rows with missing values, and creating uniform values for incongruent naming conventions. I performed data modeling by merging the three data sets, using the VLOOKUP formula, and aggregating the total scores by category, using the SUMIF formula. 

The top 5 categories are: animals, science, healthy eating, technology, and food.

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling

* Build a presentation to organize the findings on Social Buzz's content performance.
* Create data charts that best illustrate the data analysis.

Using Powerpoint, I recapped the project presented to us by Social Buzz, identified the problem this presentation is focused on addressing, broke down the analytics team, outlined our process, uncovered the insights provided by the data analysis, and summarized the team's findings and next steps. 

I included two data charts:
* A bar chart was the best choice to illustrate the top 5 content categories by aggregate popularity score and show the difference in aggregate score for each category.
* A pie chart was also used to reformat the data and was the best choice to illustrate the popularity percentage split for each of the 5 categories
